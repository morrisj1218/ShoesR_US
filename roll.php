<h3>For the true agent of CHAOS!</h3>

<p>Who knows what the hell you're gonna get! We sure don't. While blindfolded, one of our esteemed stock room clerks will litterally pull two shoes from a big box marked "MISC". Whatever he grabs gets shipped to you. You might get a right and a left, a right and a right, or even a left and a left! Law of probabilty basically guarentees the shoes you do receive will NOT be the same size.  Guarenteed to be worn slap out and just plain falling apart. Ask about authentic stained and frayed laces with your order. Price -- $ 1500.00</p>

<p>NOTE: You will NOT reveive anything anything like whats pictured above. Stock image is used for color regerence ONLY.</p>
