<h3>Say to hell with tradition and completely flip a script! WHITE!</h3>

<p>The shoes you receive will actually be nowhere near "white". White chucks are an absolute favorite for the gifted class time doodler. They're canvases for your feet! Show off your artistic side and order some "off" white chucks and as always our chucks are guarenteed to be worn slap out and just plain falling apart for all you trend following sheep out there. Ask about authentic stained and frayed laces with your order. Price -- $ 1000.00</p>

<p>NOTE: You will NOT reveive anything anything like whats pictured above. Stock image is used for color regerence ONLY.</p>
